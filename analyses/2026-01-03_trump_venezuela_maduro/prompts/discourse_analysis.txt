### 3. theme_primary - The dominant topic (choose ONE)

- "economic_benefit": The action is justified by economic gains (oil, resources, prosperity). Key indicators: economic language, resource mentions, prosperity promises
- "humanitarian_liberation": The action is justified as helping an oppressed population. Key indicators: liberation language, references to suffering, freedom rhetoric

- "historical_precedent": The action is justified by comparison to past events or leaders. Key indicators: historical references, comparisons to previous administrations
- "null": No legitimation frame present (pure information, questions, etc.)

### 7. response_type (ONLY if utterance_type is "response")
- "direct": Fully addresses the specific question asked. The answer provides the information requested
- "partial": Addresses part of the question but omits key aspects. Some information given, but question not fully answered
- "pivot": Acknowledges the question exists but redirects to a preferred topic. May use phrases like "the real question is..." or "what's important is..."
- "deflection": Ignores the question entirely and talks about something unrelated. No acknowledgment of what was asked
- "attack": Responds by criticizing the question, the questioner, or the media rather than answering
- "null": Not applicable (utterance is not a response to a question)

### 8. entities_mentioned (Named Entity Recognition)
List key entities mentioned: people (PERSON), countries (GPE), organizations (ORG), with their apparent role or valence in the statement:
